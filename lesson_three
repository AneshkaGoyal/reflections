When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would like to use a remote repository rather than keep all my work local when i have serious space issues or when i want others to help me or bebefit from my work.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Yes because i allows us as a user to commit or pull only those suggested changes which we want to incorporate into our local repository not being forced to incoorporate all thats present on Github
