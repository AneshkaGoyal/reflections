When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would like to use a remote repository rather than keep all my work local when i have serious space issues or when i want others to help me or bebefit from my work.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Yes because i allows us as a user to commit or pull only those suggested changes which we want to incorporate into our local repository not being forced to incoorporate all thats present on Github
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are clones within gitHub
clones can be the copy of a file on same local repository or copy of a file from github to local computer
branches are diversions within a repository 
We can't use one instead of the other as each has a specific use.
